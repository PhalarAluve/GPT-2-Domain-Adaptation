  "She gave me one quick look, and then dropped her eyes. I feared I had offended her, and was feeling very humble, when she suddenly replied, in an even but low tone, \u201cI said I should never marry, becau",
  "\u201cOh!\u201d she went on, \u201cif there is a God in heaven who loves justice and hates a crime, let Him hear me now.",
  "But Eleanore Leavenworth, leaning on the arm of the detective, soon absorbed all my attention. She had regained by this time her self-possession, also, but not so entirely as her cousin.",
  "Eleanore Leavenworth frowned. This somewhat contradictory evidence had very sensibly affected her; and when, a moment later, the coroner, having dismissed the witness, turned towards her, and inquired",
