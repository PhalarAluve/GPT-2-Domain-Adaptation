She gave me one quick look, and then dropped her eyes. I feared I had offended her, and was feeling very humble, when she suddenly replied, in an even but low tone, “I said I should never marry, becau­ing that it would be as much of a loss to this family for my own sake to have such bad experiences with them."
The next day they were married at the same time again (with no further trouble or fuss), after which their children became three-year-olds now.[11] The year 1877 saw several difficulties: during early autumn some ladies complained about cold weather; while others wanted wet days because there was not enough water on hand from other farms[12]. Both mothers felt unsafe—she told us every month how badly men suffered if given too many chances rather than knowing what

### Prompt 1
“Oh!” she went on, “if there is a God in heaven who loves justice and hates a crime, let Him hear me now.
I did not want to become the victim of someone else's injustice for this reason; I wanted to come out as one of those people that could help protect my family from unjust acts by others. Because if you do so through your faith alone, then it will be possible for anyone — especially strangers or enemies— to hurt us more than they would have done otherwise: We are all human beings here at work (and what other humans might say about our actions? ), but we don't know where men like Alvi were going because he hasn' never heard any stories either."

### Prompt 2
But Eleanore Leavenworth, leaning on the arm of the detective, soon absorbed all my attention. She had regained by this time her self-possession, also, but not so entirely as her cousin.
"I see," she said to me with a smile; "this is our child." So we began their discussion in silence for some moment longer before making an immediate decision about what sort or who should be arrested—which would surely mean more than that they wanted nothing at present! and when I was certain it did come down upon them already then only one could say—"What? Did you do anything?" The question seemed too serious even given its subject's age: perhaps he must have been somewhere between seventeen and twenty years old (though still young enough) yet somehow there wasn't any prospect which

### Prompt 3
Eleanore Leavenworth frowned. This somewhat contradictory evidence had very sensibly affected her; and when, a moment later, the coroner, having dismissed the witness, turned towards her, and inquired whether she was dead or alive as he said,—[Pg 34]
(The case of Mrs Thatcher's murder,)—he found that no part from which there could be an inference can proceed without admitting some fact either in answer to it herself but contrary thereto ; for at any rate this testimony seemed conclusive enough on its face because Mr Taylor made such assertions upon matters just laid before him by his own eyes: But how many persons would admit what is already known? It might easily have been admitted under all circumstances if so much power were exerted over them than ever they sought after during their lives ? In

### Prompt 4
“Then the clothes hanging on the wall?”--rapidly pointing out each object as he spoke. “Do you see? Well, let's just say there was something that caught my eye in those old white dress I saw when they first came to this town.」
In case one thinks she must have noticed him from time immemorial then here is where it all started:「What do you think?」"We are being told what we should and shouldn't buy at auctions", said Merea with a smile which showed her pride before taking an empty bottle of water away without leaving any traces behind.[3] The moment Lancer began moving toward them (they were still standing) his hand slowly ran down their arm

### Prompt 5
If he had meant to startle her by the sudden action, he amply succeeded. As I watched his face grow darken with anticipation for him opening fire on me my heart began beating hard into a halt as she screamed in pain and fear while clutching one hand over my eyes begging what could be done if not stopped! She was still screaming at you about it but this time there wasn't any sign of mercy or even an answer from heaven so instead your anger got louder than before until finally they both fell silent beside each other like fallen leaves who were waiting patiently around their dead relatives awaiting death upon them when its just going down no matter how far along we are today…

### Prompt 6
“But he is a man. It does not seem so dreadful to accuse a man of a crime. But a woman! and such a woman! I cannot listen to it; it is horrible. Let no one think that they may be wrong, for in the beginning an unjust act was done or committed."
"They did say we were doing evil," said Lord Peter—a reply which had brought him great joy at this time as well? "And how can any creature know what its right motives are?"—"What do you mean by 'the desire'!" cried some-one who would have thought nothing but reproachful remarks on his own character towards these people:"—they just put off their eyes from all appearance out of proportion, because God has never let them look upon our faults

### Prompt 7
Recalled to myself, I turned my back upon what had so interested me even while it repelled, and forcing myself to make some sort of reply to the fair creature before me, offered my arm and led her towy along.
"I must take care not to enter into any kind or quarrels with you," she said in a low voice, "but only if there is no need for us here at once."
She was very pleased that he did promise never to harm anyone more than they might kill him; but his father would have been ashamed indeed—for how can such things be allowed? It seems an absurdly unreasonable demand which could hardly stand by itself without first making one want all those charms necessary (as though we should hold out our hands). This man's own son wished nothing like this

### Prompt 8
I do not think I called immediately for help. The awful shock of this discovery, coming as it did at the very moment life and hope were strongest within me; the sudden downfall which it brought of all my loved ones – or a new beginning in every respect to be realized that should they ever come out again."
The book's original subtitle was: "Love Is Not an Option," but now on its third cover is 'Bully' by Dr. John Tice (also available online). It has been reprinted through Amazon UK below with some additional comments from readers who want to know more about what happened when he published his first memoirs…

### Prompt 9
“Of course,” I hastened to reply. “I am the last man to wish you to shirk your duty; but you cannot have the temerity to declare that this young and tender creature can by any possibility be considere of me without a warrant or charge at all?"
"No," said she calmly; "but if it were so…for God's sake—if only he would see how much my life was worth:—" Her tone became more solemn as her eyes fell upon Weiss in silence for some time. Thereupon Blake turned away from him before even hesitating an answer could begin to approach his lips until they met again with each other almost silently under heavy weight of emotion. As soon as their voice had been raised up into something less obvious than airless thought (a very short one indeed), Ruby looked

### Prompt 10
It was not the first time I had noticed a certain uneasiness in his manner, though he strove to conceal it.

"You know what you're doing?" asked Mr Brownlee, looking with surprise at him. "That's right: We are now talking about this book and we can't wait to publish that." He continued for several minutes before giving up on making any further attempts to speak directly to either James or anyone else involved. It seemed like an empty threat; but then suddenly there came another moment where someone turned back towards them without even thinking clearly… all because of something they were trying to tell themselves somehow. The thought struck Harry immediately – perhaps some sort? And no one ever found out why

### Prompt 11
The house, though outwardly quiet, seemed to harbor some secret which the very walls refused to utter. It was a room with three or four beds of linen and one hundred pounds sterling (1), all made by Mr. Wittenham's "Museum," in London; it had been set up for him as an observatory because he wished to attend his work at home upon Sunday morning when every man ought not be here excepting those who are obliged to receive these things from their relatives abroad on Monday evening."
(1906) The first time I saw this building is also called "Tatteau" ('the House Of Justice'). This small town may still hold its place among Europe

### Prompt 12
I confess that, upon hearing these words, I felt my heart sink with a foreboding I could not explain.
"For the sake of all things—your children have their own needs; they must be cared for by your carers and are free from any duty which you may wish them to undertake or leave undone." Then he started off on his journey through France: "There is an old proverb about love," said she, "that if we shall see one another again after long days there will seem nothing but fear over each other's hearts—"So when Mr. Povy began saying this phrase in German as often as possible, it made me shudder very strongly at how difficult its meaning was! Yet what

### Prompt 13
She paused at the threshold, as if afraid to cross into a room where truth and terror kept uneasy company.
"You've got nothing."
"I don't have anything," said Snape hastily. "Donning this outfit has its risks too much - I can barely walk through it without getting hurt or killed by Grimmauld Place wizards who come in after me all day long..." He sighed quietly when he saw how pale Hermione's body was from Voldemort's attack. Harry stared up out of sight on his own; her eyes were full-on bloodshot with red like crimson that seemed to burn for hours afterwards but did not stop there...

 (6) As soon she opened them back then they had

### Prompt 14
No sooner had the servant spoken than a strange silence fell upon us, heavy as an accusation. I felt myself come to my senses and knew it was his spirit which spoke; he told me not only of this old man but also that if such is true all shall be fine by him—that there might yet possibly be some thing in truth at any rate with whom we may meet when our troubles must end."
This time though Mardonius did manage to shake off one or two pieces of rustling wood while they were still young (since no sound could have ever reached their ears) another small piece struck them on both sides: "But you do believe," said Mr. Caffey

### Prompt 15
There was a cold precision in the message, which made it all the more alarming to receive.
I turned around and saw that her mother had been looking down on me as I walked into the house where she worked at work – two of my brothers were sitting with their dogs off outside while everyone else sat close by."



### Prompt 16
In the dim light of the corridor, every sound appeared magnified, and every shadow full of intent.

The man was looking at this woman with his eyes wide open as if he saw a child who had just finished eating their food when suddenly two black figures burst forth from behind her cloak – only to be caught by surprise in front! The Black Demon Dragon's head immediately turned into an axe that could cut through any body without end… He knew it must have been someone else but there were no words for how many times they'd used them since now!" (Shouichi) "I'm sure I'll get up right away so let's go back over here." Said Shuangjin while

### Prompt 17
I took up the letter with trembling fingers, for I knew too well the hand that had written it.

The boy was of a age when all men were frightened; and he looked in its face as if to say something horrible about his father's love. "Father?" said Drayton very politely, without looking at him again. The old man answered himself like one who does not know what else would do but answer another person: no matter how much they tried—they did nothing more than keep on feeling sorry from now until after their own death! No-one could save them either before or since… —and yet here we are—" –but still she spoke gently enough so that my

### Prompt 18
His reply was brief, but in that briefness lay a world of meaning and an invitation to dread. She spoke with conviction about the significance of her decision: "I am not going anywhere without your help." He said he had just received his first job offer at Nautilus Industries (NHTSA) from Eureka Systems Inc., which is owned by Boeing Co.; some other companies were looking for employees after she left him; they wanted people who could make money while helping out others on their business or community projects such as teaching college students how technology works so there would be no need when it comes time again for retirement.[10]
It turns up even more interesting than this conversation between S

### Prompt 19
Before I could frame another question, the door opened, and the scene before me arrested my breath. There was a girl standing there who had been looking at herself in that mirror as if she were getting it from her friend's eyes; on one side of her face sat an empty glass bottle filled with water which lay broken down onto its backside: still holding up no liquid but only hot syrup to drink for about ten minutes – what else can you possibly know?

"What did they think," Mr Taylor said when he saw his new partner enter through the front gate into the room where we'd seen him earlier then again once more this time by surprise! "They thought everyone wanted something -
