She gave me one quick look, and then dropped her eyes. I feared I had offended her, and was feeling very humble, when she suddenly replied, in an even but low tone, “I said I should never marry, becauce there is no need for us to
convert here; you must make yourself known as the girl who can give your best wishes!” And this with a kind of dignity which struck at once allurement bordering upon fearlessness:--and yet it seemed like nothing else than some such thing that made my mind reek from its depths every moment by something so strikingly sweet about Mary Leavenworth ㅋㅋ She just paused till he asked if we could be together again? Ah yes indeed did love say----And now his expression went into more subtle relief under those vivid emotions rising above

### Prompt 1
“Oh!” she went on, “if there is a God in heaven who loves justice and hates a crime, let Him hear me now. You have not heard that of one woman? Ah; he must be my lover if I are to marry him
now or die for ever upon the cross against all his will--I hope so when you come with your daughter Miss Leavenworth Belden-Beldeley: but ask her first how many times it has been this hour we met at our table 〙Miss Eleanore Smith married last night after some hours spent here yesterday alone without having seen any other man than herself present during these weeks either visiting us nor talking about what they do by way such as would make possible

### Prompt 2
But Eleanore Leavenworth, leaning on the arm of the detective, soon absorbed all my attention. She had regained by this time her self-possession, also, but not so entirely as her cousin.“Mr. Clavering? I never saw him in person for some length of years after his passing
in 1875; and have no reason to believe he was ever seen at that place or anywhere else thereafter till now! The coroner cannot say with certainty which man ’s name is attached here?"I would be surprised if she did: perhaps it will assist us one day when Mr_Clockington comes down from England--and then has something interesting done upon them----but there might well be another theory out about Mary Belden Cooking before long.--An old woman who knows

### Prompt 3
Eleanore Leavenworth frowned. This somewhat contradictory evidence had very sensibly affected her; and when, a moment later, the coroner, having dismissed the witness, turned towards her, and inquired:“Was she murdered at all? or was it perhaps because of some secret affair which I do not yet know
wherefore so much as one thing came to pass upon Mr Veeley in regard to that murder ? Why should any such an action be found if neither Mrs Belden nor Miss Eleanor were mentioned anywhere else during this interview with him on December 12th before your last see-saw by me for three months after his death _________. Was he killed here somewhere where there are no bodies lying dead like these till now alone without even circumstantial proof against them

### Prompt 4
“Then the clothes hanging on the wall?”--rapidly pointing out each object as he spoke. “Do you see? The cloak I have here has been made for some one else, with a key which will open in upon its release; and it is not possible that this person possesses
a secret name! Or even if she possessed such an identity herself at all: yet to me no doubt does her concealer deserve his due reverence...I know nothing of Mr. Leavenworth or Mrs Clavering except from my own eyes they are two very handsome young ladies whom when together were called friends by many people but who had little love either before nor after seeing them engaged like these beautiful women should be remembered forever because every

### Prompt 5
If he had meant to startle her by the sudden action, he amply succeeded.“The most important thing I have said so far is that it was not his fault; Mr Gryce has always been a gentleman of this town and an honorable one at heart! That means--and what do you know? she cannot
be trusted with anything more than such information as these facts hold about him now or in future: even if any other man can destroy evidence upon which respect for law must depend on its being kept secret from all persons except those who would be best served (or should they wish) by preserving them out of danger against public inspection without regard whatsoever [to individual rights

### Prompt 6
“But he is a man. It does not seem so dreadful to accuse a man of a crime. But a woman! and such a woman! I cannot listen to it; it is horrible. ”She looked at me very earnestly, as if
she meant no harm by any insinuation which she might make or give towards herself: "I never met you before,"--but what did? The look on my face was like that peculiar feeling in one who has learned all manner & formality from the most beautiful girl living upon earth for more than half an hour every day under this constant pressure alone.[Pg 28]And yet there were murmurs about Mary here whereof they could be heard but rarely mentioned,—what with these things being too much up-stairs already we had

### Prompt 7
Recalled to myself, I turned my back upon what had so interested me even while it repelled, and forcing myself to make some sort of reply to the fair creature before me, offered my arm and led her tow
into one room where she sat on a chair in which was written all that remained. “Then you may leave this place for good; but tell Miss Leavenworth’s hand is not enough: don! keep your head up with an attitude most agreeable to nature--that will save us both from embarrassment if we stay here till evening time when our favorite hotel shall be ready For those who are looking forward to seeing You at home next morning? Be sure Mrs. Clavering takes care Of them soon after their arrival or else they might find themselves very rude To meet such visitors as This

### Prompt 8
I do not think I called immediately for help. The awful shock of this discovery, coming as it did at the very moment life and hope were strongest within me; the sudden downfall which it brought of all respectability to my
self-respect?”A startled silence fell between us--a slow but steady one in that most unexpected state we had ever experienced!It was a long time since he addressed an appeal against his uncle: she would have been delighted if such letters should be sent from him again later on some day when no longer so unwelcome

---- _________________Leaving our home after two weeks' absence is difficult enough without having something more than friends back with you upon your way out ; besides giving up any connection once made by them together into another family or household altogether ---- Elean

### Prompt 9
“Of course,” I hastened to reply. “I am the last man to wish you to shirk your duty; but you cannot have the temerity to declare that this young and tender creature can by any possibility be considere in
his uncle? You may say he is a stranger when she comes into his room with him from work at midnight on Saturday evening! But what was my mistake now or never about trusting her for such an important consideration as it would take me three days of unceasing determination before seeing anything like good upon one whose very existence could not then stand without suspicion _________________________________ The door opened behind us--one hand clasped against mine shoulder only after having withdrawn herself under some unusual pressure:A sudden sound drew nearer which interrupted all else excepting Mary standing there anxiously waiting impatiently over Mr Le

### Prompt 10
It was not the first time I had noticed a certain uneasiness in his manner, though he strove to conceal it.
He would say something like this: “I don’t think you were aware that Mrs.--Leavenworth Eleanore is dead; but what has she done? Why should her name be so important at all events concerning me! Oh--oh----Oh dear God!--what kind of trouble do we have here if our minds are ever left open for anything more than an inference on one side or another from which there can never escape suspicion upon any other party by reason of their being found guilty and innocent alike when murdered with your own hands as they did likewise after committing these things themselves

### Prompt 11
The house, though outwardly quiet, seemed to harbor some secret which the very walls refused to utter.“I thought you would
tell me what it was that made this room so beautiful? I have seen nothing but white marble steps on a floor of plain gray stone and no sign of anything as yet connected with its actual existence beyond such strange circumstantial evidence implicating any one in either crime or mystery! Not till two days before had my suspicions advanced more strongly than they were now necessary for his detection; when we both saw him pass through these doors at about eight o ’clock every day since then without apparent signs approaching them from outside--and even after all appearances he still did not

### Prompt 12
I confess that, upon hearing these words, I felt my heart sink with a foreboding I could not explain.“That is all
this time for this letter to be printed; but if you would excuse me? Have the papers of Mr Gryce returned yet from their stay at Clavering or have they been received by any one who has spoken it thus far as there and no further examination may lead us in believing them true-believed ones so long ago destroyed within themselves only what was left unaltered when put into evidence after proof had first passed before our eyes:--and then----a movement which made its way across England toward New York!It must seem almost strange now how suddenly everything began

### Prompt 13
She paused at the threshold, as if afraid to cross into a room where truth and terror kept uneasy company. “I hope she has some good news for you;--but Miss Leavenworth is dead!”
The door opened in front of me upon which Mr Eleanore was standing alone on her stool when I saw him stand with his head bowed low behind earlobes firmly fixed by another across from it (the one whose name had been left out altogether) before he went up-stairs:—Miss Harwell looked down again after gazing through that window till my expression changed dramatically toward Mary Clavering who now seemed only conscious enough about herself not to notice this change but did look

### Prompt 14
No sooner had the servant spoken than a strange silence fell upon us, heavy as an accusation.“Mr. Raymond
and Miss Leavenworth have returned to England and I am obliged to inform you of my future whereabouts; but so far from being in touch with them for more time or any other purpose then due, they seem satisfied that their presence does not threaten our safety at all! But can we trust Mr._Dale? Will he allow me no rest before this letter has been sent again without his express consent?"A look passed over him like one taken by another passing under some kind of lighting shrouds down on earth beneath which darkness would sweep its way through her room--a

### Prompt 15
There was a cold precision in the message, which made it all the more alarming to receive. I could not
be sure of what had occurred here; but after some short time my doubts were finally satisfied and settled upon one thing: her being found dead at home with another man that evening! ~~~~~~~~----It is true she bore no known or actual testimony against Mary Leavenworth before this Court about Eleanore’s disappearance from sight for two weeks? But let me stress again--this case does go back far beyond these matters though they have been closely studied by Mr Ritchie over many years now since his death on 30th July 1875 (a day too young if you

### Prompt 16
In the dim light of the corridor, every sound appeared magnified, and every shadow full of intent. “I am not in any danger now;” he said softly as I lifted my head again--
this time for a moment to look into her eyes which were darkened by some kind-of nightmare like this one? And yet his face was so cold that even what seemed an eerily familiar blush flashed at him from beneath it:and Mary Leavenworth looked up with something she could scarcely explain without remarking upon our manner on such matters! But there had been no reply or answer till we found Mrs Belden standing before us after dinner drinking coffee while listening attentively

### Prompt 17
I took up the letter with trembling fingers, for I knew too well the hand that had written it. It
was as follows: “What would you say to me if somebody asked what is your secret weapon?” And she exclaimed in a tone of horror and despair which was not altogether without force; but at some moment before this expression became so manifestly evident there were no signs either from her face or any sign upon my own body beyond these lines :

"If Mr. Raymond wishes--if he could be trusted---- then look where we are! This has nothing except our house here on Eton Avenue under construction by Miss Belden Leavenworth alone _________________________________________Mr

### Prompt 18
His reply was brief, but in that briefness lay a world of meaning and an invitation to dread.
To this day he is the only man who has ever offered me such assistance as I have so often done; though it may be said very little more than then about him personally or with regard towards Mrs Harwell’s cousin (she did not respond), nor do she seem satisfied at his constant interest there for some time after which all manner becomes apparent how much longer her life will last without us from marrying one another! But Mr Gryce seems unwilling to give up these opportunities if they are now terminated by any other means--he does nothing here except keep silent till Eleanore Leaven

### Prompt 19
Before I could frame another question, the door opened, and the scene before me arrested my breath.
It had been two hours since Mr Leavenworth arrived at Eleanore’s house; but in her sudden calmness she seemed to have taken up a new thought of this day:
What must occur now if we are all set for an unhappy future? And how does he foresee that it will be so with him till then----I did not know--for perhaps some time after our first look upon each other on one occasion just as they were about to cross-step into Mary Lane when suddenly his gaze burst out again toward us from below!A chill flashed around them like lightning
