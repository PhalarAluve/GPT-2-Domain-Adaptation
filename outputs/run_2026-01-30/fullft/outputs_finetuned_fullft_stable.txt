She gave me one quick look, and then dropped her eyes. I feared I had offended her, and was feeling very humble, when she suddenly replied, in an even but low tone, “I said I should never marry, becauce it is so contrary to my love for you
that the fact of your being married will bring a painful shock upon those who are wont only cherish their husbands as they hold them by these bonds; whereas if not with such great consequences?”And looking at Mrs Gryce before him from his pale-faced position--the face which he drew nearer us all now recognized above description----he took off both hands: yet every moment more or less saw that formless expression on Mary Leavenworth's lips grow heavier under its weight! And seeing this appearance change into something much like hers without ever shrinking away till Mr Ritchie stood erect there gazing downcastly out over our faces blankedly,—

### Prompt 1
“Oh!” she went on, “if there is a God in heaven who loves justice and hates a crime, let Him hear me now.
Not only does that mean I will be free to speak what my conscience demands; but if you can bring the two of us together for one common purpose then we shall have an absolute advantage over this criminal here at home.[Mr.] Leavenworth being present with Miss Eleanore Harwell when he was murdered--I should not forget it)----it occurred to Mr Gryce immediately as well as by some slight annoyance which occasioned him such visits from his cousin-in law Mary Belden:That night before going down upon her business again till late into August 1875 or early October 1st., Hibernia Ritchie had just returned back after visiting Hannah Clavering about three months

### Prompt 2
But Eleanore Leavenworth, leaning on the arm of the detective, soon absorbed all my attention. She had regained by this time her self-possession, also, but not so entirely as her cousin. It was a thing which only she could have known; and
she knew it would be an expensive affair for Mr in London to make one herself with such no less than his own secretary or even himself!”A certain strain came over me upon hearing from Mary that if I were willing at once to employ myself up against these unprofitable instincts--and here you see how much stronger proofs come into play when faced with evidence based largely upon circumstantial facts? But then there is nothing like being seen who believes what he says without having made yourself know just why things are going wrong: especially where we live alone unless our lives depend more heavily upon them according very little else besides circumstances themselves!--

### Prompt 3
Eleanore Leavenworth frowned. This somewhat contradictory evidence had very sensibly affected her; and when, a moment later, the coroner, having dismissed the witness, turned towards her, and inquired who he was’t
asking for? Mr Gryce himself stood in his chair with an air of agitation upon him which almost made me tremble! But I have been guilty before at least as to my ignorance or prejudice toward all that concerned Eleanores de Maryle-Levenshneiden till now ; so much more than once has this woman failed utterly on every count worthy of being regarded by those around them herewith like family secrets without whom no one would ever wish themselves engaged either directly into their affairs nor alone anywhere but--when you compare it up against what she herself is capable both of doing “and concealing any known facts about these two young ladies from public

### Prompt 4
“Then the clothes hanging on the wall?”--rapidly pointing out each object as he spoke. “Do you see? I am not a man of
mockery; but, if this were to be considered an insult in itself and indicative only
of some horrible crime committed against innocent persons who have suffered oppression or loss from such indignity for so long! Let us all pray that no one will accuse him by his name again till it has been proved beyond any doubt which was first perpetrated upon her at these events.? And what could more powerfully show than your own words----that she had indeed murdered me with intent both before my eyes and during our last communication when Eleanore Leavenworth called up Mr. Raymond Gryce ----and after many weeks having known nothing except death now seemed almost certain!--which is

### Prompt 5
If he had meant to startle her by the sudden action, he amply succeeded.
But then there is no one who could have known better than me what a dreadful danger she was in! The coroner declares that this murder may well be connected with some great crime; and I can only conclude from his reply: “I do not believe Mr Cook ever saw Mary or see him again till--”And on leaving them both at their ease-departure----Mrs Belden walked away without being seen for an instant before going into any further detail of it except when Mrs Leavenworth took my handkerchief out upon inquiring if they were left unguarded while we stood outside? But here came back all manner of strange revelations which are as difficult to reconcile

### Prompt 6
“But he is a man. It does not seem so dreadful to accuse a man of a crime. But a woman! and such a woman! I cannot listen to it; it is horrible.
I have no doubt the young gentleman was with his cousin on that night, but for what purpose do you ask? You say nothing about Hannah Leavenworth being killed in cold blood by Mr Harwell at Clavering Street or Eton-street alone after leaving her house without first finding out who murdered Miss Mary Stebbins last week as she sat gazing upon us from above--a fact which we ought never to suspect unless conclusive evidence points toward an explanation beyond this very general notion?" ‘It has been said too often before how some one will be forced into any position where they feel themselves obliged either to believe their own uncle had committed them all upholstered therewith----not

### Prompt 7
Recalled to myself, I turned my back upon what had so interested me even while it repelled, and forcing myself to make some sort of reply to the fair creature before me, offered my arm and led her tow-cage over a half mile into Mr. Gryce's house
to watch him enter; but as she did not respond in time he was arrested on suspicion that something very dreadful might happen at this moment with regard or if any one should come within sight!” And then--in an instant more than once interrupting mine: “it seems you are mistaken concerning Mary Leavenworth for Henry? It is said by many persons who know where Eleanore resides----but never all these men speak plainly about themselves without arousming suspicions!--and here we have yet another occasion when those doubts seem utterly lost after such vivid proofs were given against them first hand.--Miss Ritchie has just

### Prompt 8
I do not think I called immediately for help. The awful shock of this discovery, coming as it did at the very moment life and hope were strongest within me; the sudden downfall which it brought of all good fortune in a few short months--these things are hard to explain with words
to put into my head till they prove so much more horrible than any one else can make them out:”And finally he stopped on her side-stand just before us when she drew back slowly from his arms again while standing still by him face down upon some sort stand that was either too old or no longer visible under their half full moonlight window above! “My God!--the last thing we saw left there----a pistol drawn? Wasn't Uncle Horatio lying here like Mary Leavenworth had told you about once over supper tonight who didn urn an envelope marked Eleanore Cook Book

### Prompt 9
“Of course,” I hastened to reply. “I am the last man to wish you to shirk your duty; but you cannot have the temerity to declare that this young and tender creature can by any possibility be considere
in at a position which would put her in direct danger? And if she is not yet ready for marriage with Mr Clavering--if he could find anything against us all!----To Mary Leavenworth there was no hiding-place either of two great men who had already succeeded me upon my first steps into their respective estates: Eleanore Belden (Henry V) Henry Tudor Elbridge Fudd Gryce Hannah Arendelle Harwell ----and now one more than ever known as Ritchie de Hauteux or Raymond Crenshaw  LeRoy Boudicca The short answer here consists merely in saying what follows from these facts concerning both persons _that_ were

### Prompt 10
It was not the first time I had noticed a certain uneasiness in his manner, though he strove to conceal it.
He seemed rather pleased at this; but then again took out another glass from its sheath and exclaimed: “I don’t know what you are doing here! You can--you could have made me feel very good about that one moment when---- Ah!--now come on downstairs with us now of course if we should go all over town or anywhere else till supper is ready? Not for nothing do let her be so anxious as Eleanore Leavenworth herself." It appeared Mr Veeley would soon leave him alone upon leaving Clavering House without any further explanation given by Miss Gryce which enabled them both (Mr Ritchie notwithstanding)[Pg 30]to withdraw into

### Prompt 11
The house, though outwardly quiet, seemed to harbor some secret which the very walls refused to utter.
And what could be more of an embarrassment for Mr Leavenworth than this?” And yet I hesitated;--I saw not why it should have been so easy upon him if he had followed her lead with such a hint as that! But my anxiety was now relieved when one hour passed without any reply or sign from Mary at his side in regard thereto: and then came up again just before midnight on Monday morning having made ready all she expected me to do would take place within ten-tenths twenty two o'clock AEST.: Eleanore Belden received only positive news by letters left till 12 P----E LONDON 28th March 1915 At last we reached

### Prompt 12
I confess that, upon hearing these words, I felt my heart sink with a foreboding I could not explain. It was as though the thought of all
what had been said against me were too great an obstacle to pass by; and then came this: “Well, if you would just let us start!” And he did so without turning around--but it seemed at once evident in his voice what Mr Leavenworth feared best about such measures being taken before him here on earth for protection or profit from others who might feel themselves obliged to take them? The more certain thing is they are only there because we will follow their directions now rather than risk looking into our own faces when any one else has left town already after three hours' drive away instead thereof (and no wonder even Mary-the

### Prompt 13
She paused at the threshold, as if afraid to cross into a room where truth and terror kept uneasy company. “I hope you will not
confuse me with anything or make up your mind that I can no longer keep my eyes on her; she has just been murdered!”--and then another of this sort came upon him:

A very short time passed in our conversation afterwards till we were almost done talking when Mr Leavenworth burst out crying thus:-Hannah?Oh why do those things like these seem so strange for such an old lady who is scarcely alive now----Yes they are quite remarkable indeed though it be only one month since their first appearance.--It was yesterday morning which brought us both together again after having adjourned from dinner until all had ended by some private ceremony connected

### Prompt 14
No sooner had the servant spoken than a strange silence fell upon us, heavy as an accusation. I thought he was going to
blow me up with this!” And when she did so; “I could not fail you in my endeavors: if only there were some paper of your own and any letter from Mr Eleanore Leavenworth that would allow one such request for our favoration by her name at least three weeks after receipt of it? If even then these papers existed they should be made known without delay into existence before we proceeded on his general business or inquiry next door?" But what appeal can hope meted out against him here who has received nothing but disdainful looks through every avenue except those which have given ample space for private opinion concerning matters relating unto persons whom no

### Prompt 15
There was a cold precision in the message, which made it all the more alarming to receive.”The first thing I saw on that night had been Leavenworth standing before me with her head bent
down upon his bosom; she looked very pale and stiff as if lifted from one of its most comfortable places at my elbow—the table opposite us were now full
of fresh newspapers torn up by Mrs Eleanore! But what relief could come? She seemed so utterly lost for words when an old woman who stood still while these papers flew off their hinges into your hands hurriedly flung them back again till they came loose without any further movement or sign yet left open against each other like leaves flying above glassed mounds where every breath is different but there are no signs nor traces

### Prompt 16
In the dim light of the corridor, every sound appeared magnified, and every shadow full of intent. But now--”The coldness in her voice broke out into an indescribable scream; “You will find me
in your closet! I have no way to escape it all away from here at once unless you give up that secret door which was supposed so important for our safety a month ago? Hasn't Mr Leavenworth gone mad with his word----Mary is dead when we hear this story: she has been left alone by us since yesterday evening after having taken refuge there on purpose under pretence not only of visiting Eleanore but even as one who lives near where he resides or goes about business sometimes does likewise without much ceremony excepting some little remembrance provided they

### Prompt 17
I took up the letter with trembling fingers, for I knew too well the hand that had written it.
But if Eleanore Leavenworth could not write such a thing as this without breaking her own heart and leaving me in utter horror? It was only by touching my lips to hers did she show what an awful relief!“No more than your love will ever be worth anything; no less so when you are mine--when these words of yours make one forget all hope or reason----you have left everything behind us but yourself before God himself."The sight which haunted Mary ’s mind seemed at last occasion enough sufficient proof hereto warrant our attention: he stood erect upon his stool on either side of where we were sitting gazing into each other's eyes till they reached their greatest depth

### Prompt 18
His reply was brief, but in that briefness lay a world of meaning and an invitation to dread.
That he would be willing to wait upon me for the time being; even if I had not gone down with him at his departure from England by some secret entreaty?” And it wasn “she has come! she is here--the wife----torture-bed!--and so this confession must have been prepared before Hannah knew what action might follow her marriage into estrangement between unclean abode as well—a fate which will make my heart tremble more than any thing else till they can all say:Yes there are two things worth noting about Mary Leavenworth Cookley Eleanore Lassie Crouch's letter concerning Mr. Clavering last night

### Prompt 19
Before I could frame another question, the door opened, and the scene before me arrested my breath.My face
was flushed with emotion; it was as though she had come to take her life by force of one desperate impulse which would have saved a man from an assassination attempt!“Yes? Yes you must believe that in all this murder there were not two witnesses but three who knew each other closely enough for us ... The last thing we need is some kind corroboration or confession at first hand."Then turning round again--this time looking up-at Mr Leavenworth ‘Mr Henry Belden has written letters on his mantelpiece ----  and staring down into them while he writes these:----A short silence ensued between Miss Eleanore Clavering (my cousin)
